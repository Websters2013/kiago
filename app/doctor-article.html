        <h2>Quality standards for doctors</h2>

        <p>Our doctors make up the very core of our communities. You bring a unique medical perspective, expertise and passion, to the field of preventative healthcare and wellness. One main prerequisite in having you on board is the <strong>willingness to collaborate</strong> with your Kaigo team in order to <strong>educate</strong> and bring <strong>healing</strong> to your community. By doing so, you are able to offer members and other health partners an experience you wouldn’t be able to offer independently. To help ensure all doctors meet the community’s expectations, you must meet the standards listed below before members or partners can book Kaigo experiences and appointments with you.</p>

        <p><strong>These standards apply to your individual consultations as well as group experiences.</strong></p>

        <p>They will also help you earn great member reviews and partner recommendations. You can see how you’re doing by checking feedback from members and partners. Keep in mind that if you consistently receive low ratings or complaints or there are other indications that you do not meet these standards, your practice may be temporarily deactivated or removed from the platform. Please remember that we are here to help so always feel free to reach out to us if you are uncertain about any of these standards.</p>

        <h2>Standards</h2>

        <p>Doctors share their knowledge with members and health partners in their community, creating opportunities for all to gain new insights and develop a different viewpoint about healthy living. They’re excited to go out of their way to create a different healthcare experience.</p>
