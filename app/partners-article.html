        <h2>Quality standards for Wellness Partners</h2>

        <p>Wellness partners at Kaigo provide preventative health services and compliment the doctor’s offering. In order to provide services and unique experiences to the community, wellness partners must be <strong>willing to collaborate</strong> with other local partners on the platform. The primary goal is to promote an environment where personal connections are nurtured through educational and entertaining experiences.</p>

        <p>Partners including personal chefs, dietitians, personal trainers, yoga instructors, acupuncturists and any other professional involved in preventative health and wellness services.</p>

        <p>Wellness experiences are one-of-a-kind activities that tell the story of the wellness professional’s unique service, perspective and passion, offering members something that random internet searches can’t. To help ensure all experiences meet the community’s expectations, they must meet the standards below before members can book.</p>

        <strong>These standards apply to your individual consultations as well as group experiences.</strong>

        <p>These standards can also help you earn great reviews. You can see how you’re doing by checking ratings and feedback from your guests. Keep in mind that if you consistently receive low ratings or there are other indications that you do not meet these standards, your experience and services may be temporarily deactivated or removed from the platform.</p>

        <h2>Standards</h2>

        <p>Wellness partners enthusiastically share their passion and local knowledge and skill with the world, creating opportunities for guests to gain new insights and a different viewpoint. They’re excited to go out of their way to create meaningful, memorable moments.</p>
